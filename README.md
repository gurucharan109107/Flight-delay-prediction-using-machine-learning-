# Flight-delay-prediction-using-machine-learning-
Predicting flight delay can help passengers and other stakeholders in great a way to better utilize their time or make different plans. Here a Kaggle dataset is used for such flight delay prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction). The data is month of January from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Govt. of the USA. This dataset contains all the flights in the month of January 2019 and January 2020.

As part of this project the following tasks are performed:

Downloaded a real-world dataset from a Kaggle competition and identified a problem to work on with the dataset, stated the modeling objective with clarity.

Performed exploratory data analysis to gather insights, perform feature engineering, created a training, validation & test split, and prepared the data for modeling.

Trained and evaluated different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost, tuned hyperparameters to improve models.

The final performance of best models are evaluated with an unseen test data and also compared models with dump models created from good understanding of data.

Implemented function for sample predictions, and saved model weights and loaded back and tested.
